# ListSharp

A language made for the editing of lists and blocks of text without any programming experience needed to operate it.

* made to be intuitive and easy to understand,with a word rich English based syntax.

* made in c# and opensource for any future improvements people might want to commit.

* made with ease of installation in mind, without any special dependencies besides .net needed.

* made due to the lack of innovation and work done on the automation of such simple tasks.
